My_Tinder_Bot

The HTML Structure is changing constantly, and even from device to device
I tried my best to write a code that is not failing to do the task

I added data_to_csv in order to make a formatted csv out of the mess

you need to add your own csv with FB_USERNAME, FB_PASSWORD

- it'll deal with login problems, but first you need to log in manually with FB to make sure they won't send verifications codes
- It could as well extract the names and the profile data into CSV 
- all the content is for learning purposes only

hope that's helpful
